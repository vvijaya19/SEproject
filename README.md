The global agriculture sector is facing unprecedented challenges, including labor shortages, rising production costs, and environmental concerns. To address these challenges, farmers are increasingly turning to drone automation as a transformative solution. 

Large-scale farms face numerous challenges, including:
Labor Shortages: Finding and retaining skilled labor is a significant challenge for large-scale farms.
Rising Production Costs: The increasing cost of inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides, puts pressure on profit margins.
Environmental Concerns: The overuse of chemicals and the need for extensive labor can have detrimental environmental impacts.

Our project is focused on developing a software solution that utilizes drone automation to enhance efficiency and productivity in large-scale farming operations.
