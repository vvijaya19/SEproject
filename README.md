The global agriculture sector is facing unprecedented challenges, including labor shortages, rising production costs, and environmental concerns. To address these challenges, farmers are increasingly turning to drone automation as a transformative solution. 

Large-scale farms face numerous challenges, including:
Labor Shortages: Finding and retaining skilled labor is a significant challenge for large-scale farms.
Rising Production Costs: The increasing cost of inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides, puts pressure on profit margins.
Environmental Concerns: The overuse of chemicals and the need for extensive labor can have detrimental environmental impacts.

Our project is focused on developing a software solution that utilizes drone automation to enhance efficiency and productivity in large-scale farming operations.

Instructions to Run the project:
To add an itemcontainer, we select root and click Itemcontainer. Once Itemcontainer is added, the visualization is automatically updated.
To add an Item under ItemContainer, we select Itemcontainer and then add an iten with particular values. In this also, visualization is updated.
we can change the prices, location of x, y , price, length, width and height for both items and item container by clicking the respective buttons. The visualization will be updated respectively.
To scan the farm, we can click scan farm in drone actions.
To visit the item/item container select the item and press the button, it goes to the respective part in visualization.
we can click item? item container to get purchase price and market price.
